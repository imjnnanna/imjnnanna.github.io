I"<<p>Hi.</p>

<p>What’s up?</p>

<p>Oh, right.</p>

<p>I see you,</p>

<p>but you’re not me;</p>

<p>you don’t see me.</p>

<p>Only through a one-sided screen,</p>

<p>I wake up to your face,</p>

<p>logging in, with a few taps;</p>

<p>your everyday life, your best moments,</p>

<p>I screenshot, memorize the most obscure details.</p>

<p>Two silver piercings on your left earlobe,</p>

<p>one on your right, complete with a helix.</p>

<p>The homecoming dress that you re-wore to prom.</p>

<p>Your makeup habits, the brand of your sunscreen,</p>

<p>The way you stood on a sunset-lit beach, heads tilted,</p>

<p>Your eating disorder, the way you’re proud of it, your mirror selfies.</p>

<p>The bruise on your left knee that lasted a month after playing volleyball.</p>

<p>How much you miss your ex while you post pictures of the two of you,</p>

<p>blurring out his face, photoshopping yours, pretending that you’re over it, making faces; it’s not me.</p>

<p>The exact amount you make working minimum wage at the local McDonald’s, down to every last cent.</p>

<p>Your best friend and you, always posting, tagging each other, but I know that you both are too scared to find better friends.</p>

<p>The fake that you used to get into a night club, downing a martini while adjusting the speck of foundation peeling off your face.</p>

<p>And the decision you made that night, on the wheels, highway, posting about it, temporary and you deleting it just hours later—what saint could have saved you?</p>

<p>Blood rushes to your cheeks artificially as you squeeze them painfully, to make yourself look good on camera without blush, the no-makeup look, and you open a mouth full of filtered-perfect teeth and grimace one eye shut.</p>

<p>But you don’t know me, although maybe be more situationally aware; you could probably find me quickly if you wanted to.</p>

<p>I’m not just one of your thousands of empty-minded followers.</p>

<p>I’m always near you, closer than anyone else.</p>

<p>Not the screen.</p>

<p>Look back.</p>

<p>It’s me.</p>

<p>Hello, and</p>

<p>goodbye.</p>

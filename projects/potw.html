<h1>Choate STEM Problem of the Week</h1>

<div class = "post_content"><p>The Choate STEM Problem of the Week was a server posting student-made problems weekly, broadcasting to all the STEM club Discords at Choate—including CPU, GirlTech, Math, Linguistics, Physics, Chess, and QuizBowl. Another student and I collaborated on setting up a Discord and organizing problems. I was the main lead in creating a <a href="https://github.com/RyanYunruiYang/potw-bot">Discord bot</a> automating problem announcements, solution submission, and a leaderboard point system.</p>

<p>This page serves as an archive of all problems from the server.</p>

Problem statement: 
Tone is very important in the East African language Maasai. Vowels written with an acúte accent have high tone, those with a gràve accent have low tone, and those without an accent have mid tone.

(Pronunciation guide: 
ɔ = "awe"
ɛ = "let"
ɪ = "bit"
ʊ = "hood"
ŋ = "song")

Here are some sentences in Maasai: 

1) éósh ɔlmʊraní ɔlásʊráɪ̀
2) áadɔ́l ɔlasʊráɪ́
3) áaósh ɔlmʊraní
4) ɪ́dɔ́l ɔlmʊránì

8) áaduŋokí ɔlmʊraní ɔlcɛtá
9) áadúŋ ɔlmʊraní

You have 100 different kinds of pills, 99 are harmless and 1 of them is poisonous. You wish to determine which type is poisonous. You have at your disposal an infinite supply of rabbits. 

You may complete a single-day experiment. In the morning, you give each rabbit some set of pills and it eats all of them. Later that day, your research assistant will tell you which rabbits got poisoned.

What is the minimum number of participating rabbits needed to guarantee determining which type of pill is poisonous if you have:
(1) one of each kind of pill (1 point, ~1 jalapeno) 
(2) two of each kind of pill (1 points, ~2.5 jalapeno)

Given a list of N unique numbers, give an algorithm/method guaranteeing to find a local minimum (not absolute minimum) in time complexity &lt; O(N). The time required to read in the list is ignored.

Point distribution: 1 point for algorithm, 1 point for time complexity of algorithm, 1 point for reasoning.

Clarifications:
1. A local min is some number that is smaller than both of its neighbors.
2. What  &lt;O(n) means is that you need to find an algorithm such that if it executes in f(N) moves for a list with N numbers, then the limit as N goes to infinity of f(N)/N is 0.

Problem statement:
You are given an array of integers. You are allowed to make calculations and store memory as you wish based on this array. Then, you will be given a random continuous subset of the array, and asked to find the standard deviation of the subset. A constraint is that you are not allowed to iterate over any arrays after being given the subset (making the time complexity O(1)). This means that no matter what subset you are given, you will be able to return the standard deviation in the same time complexity.
What is the minimal amount of memory needed for your pre-calculations in order to find the standard deviation with this limitation?

One way would be to calculate and store the standard deviation for every possible subset of the array using a large "answer key" array of size 2^n. Any answers more optimal than this solution will be accepted and awarded 0-3 points depending on its optimality.

Difficulty: NA. Your submission will be competing against others' submissions.

Problem Statement: 
This week's POTW will be a Blotto round due at 11:59pm EST, February 13th, 2022. You will submit a list of nine non-negative integers that sum to 100 to either the bot or https://forms.gle/4qFr8iJfTEsZuN5w9. For example, "100 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0" is a valid submission. All submissions will be played against each other and ranked based on the rules explained in the dropbox document. POTW points will be assigned based on the rankings.

Details about how matchups will be scored:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ou49kyfymf0td5k/Blotto_Round_1__BOTW_%20(2).pdf?dl=0

EDIT 2/13: 
Just a reminder that submissions are due tonight. In case the original explanation was unclear, here's another attempt at an explanation. You're fighting for control on a 3x3 grid,

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

and you send some number of troops to each of the sites. Then, based on who gets control, points are awarded. You get 1 point for controlling a square, and 2 more points for each row, column, diagonal that you achieve.

Example: In A = (11,11,11,11,12,11,11,11,11) vs. B = (20, 0, 0, 20, 20, 20, 0 ,0 ,20), the grid looks alike

B A A
B B B 
A A B

so A gets 4 + 2* 0 = 4 points, and B gets 5 + 2*2 = 9 points, and B wins the matchup.

Problem Statement: Happy (Belated) Pi Day!
One way to calculate pi is with a monte carlo simulation. This is done by sampling x from [-1,1] and y from [-1,1]. The probability that any such sample satisfies x^2+y^2&lt;1 is pi/4.

If you repeatedly samplen times, then you can estimate pi as 4*(# inside the circle)/n. 
Let d be the number of digits guaranteed to you by the 99%  confidence interval. Find the functional dependence between n and d.

Stats Notes: The formula for the 99% confidence interval is mean +- 1.960 * (STDEV / sqrt(# of samples)).

The formula for the standard deviation is STDEV = sqrt(variance). Variance is equal to E[(x-avg)^2] = E[x^2] - E[x]^2. Also, note that Var(X+Y) = Var(X)+ Var(Y)  when X and Y are uncorrelated variables.

Hint (7/28): White has mate in &lt;=2
Hint (7/31): This position is very hard to reach. considering what black's most recent move was is very helpful.

Problem Statement: Let X = (1-1/2)(1-1/4)(1-1/8)(1-1/16)(1-1/32)(1-1/64)(1-1/128)..... = prod_{n=1}^{infty} (1- 0.5^n). You can easily get an upper bound by computing a few terms, but getting a lower bound is much harder. Find a lower bound on X and you will be scored based on the strength of the lower bound:
 - X&gt;0: 2 points
 - X&gt;=63/256: 3 points
 - X&gt;=1/4: 4 points
 - X&gt;=9/32: 5 points
You can use a calculator, but I'll just tell you that X is approximately 0.28878.

Remark (where this problem came from): In F_2, the probability that a NxN matrix with randomly selected entries is invertible is prod_{n=1}^{N} (1- 0.5^n)

Problem Statement:
Jewon is sitting in a van with 5 big bags of poisoned candy. She gives candy to passing children (each child gets at most one of each type). Each child either rejects the candy, or eats one candy (before immediately getting sick and not eating any more candy). For each of the 5 candies, the number of times it is given and the number of times it is eaten are listed below:
- Hazelnut: 2000 given, 1600 children sickened.
- Yellow Lemon: 2200 given, 1600 children sickened.
- Pistachio: 1900 given, 1300 children sickened.
- Strawberry: 2000 given, 1700 children sickened.
- Mint: 1400 given, 1100 children sickened.
Let M be the number of children who were offered exactly one candy, and ate that candy. Find the smallest possible value of M.

Using this value, among the sickened children, compute the proportion of them who were given exactly one candy.

Problem Statement:
A computer selects a number P, chosen uniformly from the interval [0,1] and makes a biased coin that has a probability P of turning up heads.

Suppose that you flip the coin, and it comes up heads 35 times and tails 20 times. What is the probability that the next coin flip will result in a heads?
Note: the bot is down so you should DM the solution to me (Ryan Yang).

Problem Statement:
The organizers of the world cup are planning for 2026 and want to change the number of teams in each group, but still have at least three teams in each group. They also want to keep the same structure and the same total number of games. Currently, there are 8 groups of 4, from which the top 2 advance into a 16 team knockout stage. This has 8*6=48 group stage games + 16 knockout games = 64 total games.

For example, one such alternative is 16 groups of 3, where one team advances from each group. This will have 16*3=48 group stage games and 16 knockout games, for a total of 64 games. There are two other alternatives; three points will be given for each alternative that you submit.

Find the angle between the two science building walls shown in the attached image. The only three instruments you are allowed to use are
1. a pencil
2. a ruler
3. a calculator

Two points will be given for outlining a solution, and full credit will be given for actually going to the science building (IRL!) and calculating the angle.

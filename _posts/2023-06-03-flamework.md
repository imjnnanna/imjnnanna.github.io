excerpt: Stanzas of haikus.
---
Nothing sits except\
several cold, dark blocks of\
oak wood. But at least\
it’s dry and ready\
to start sparks, always waiting\
for the single flick\
that will start as a\
slow burn, first in a square inch,\
then a square foot, then\
the entire wood block,\
spreading fierce, tumbling over\
all corners, edges.

The fire has started\
and it blazes like the sun.\
Moths gather around\
seeking warmth and light,\
grotesquely flapping sideways\
unattractive wings\
fuzzy, helpless; they\
weave through air to red demise.\
Would it be painful?\
The fur of the wings\
crackle and snap, bursting in\
a gradient of orange.

A warm end, not death,\
but a start to the unknown,\
because the flames lure\
all that see, dancing\
in flexible, elastic\
wisps of arms and legs.\
My eyes gravitate,\
attraction stronger than love,\
gravitational.\
Illumination\
licks my cheeks, it’s gentle, kind,\
delicate soft strokes.\
Then my nerves feel it.\
Thermoreceptors, screaming,\
telling me to flee.

The light stirs my skin\
like a witch does to her stew;\
it boils, blisters, scalds,\
a hint of burnt waste\
floats in the atmosphere.\
It hurts, it hurts, my\
muscle seethes in blood,\
my bones feel the crimson touch,\
Cherry-red, eyeballs\
droop, and I then throw\
my entire self to She; my\
body burns brightly.

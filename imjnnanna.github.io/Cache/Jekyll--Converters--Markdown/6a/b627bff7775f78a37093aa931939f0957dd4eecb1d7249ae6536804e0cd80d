I"<p>Nothing sits except<br />
several cold, dark blocks of<br />
oak wood. But at least<br />
it’s dry and ready<br />
to start sparks, always waiting<br />
for the single flick<br />
that will start as a<br />
slow burn, first in a square inch,<br />
then a square foot, then<br />
the entire wood block,<br />
spreading fierce, tumbling over<br />
all corners, edges.</p>

<p>The fire has started<br />
and it blazes like the sun.<br />
Moths gather around<br />
seeking warmth and light,<br />
grotesquely flapping sideways<br />
unattractive wings<br />
fuzzy, helpless; they<br />
weave through air to red demise.<br />
Would it be painful?<br />
The fur of the wings<br />
crackle and snap, bursting in<br />
a gradient of orange.</p>

<p>A warm end, not death,<br />
but a start to the unknown,<br />
because the flames lure<br />
all that see, dancing<br />
in flexible, elastic<br />
wisps of arms and legs.<br />
My eyes gravitate,<br />
attraction stronger than love,<br />
gravitational.<br />
Illumination<br />
licks my cheeks, it’s gentle, kind,<br />
delicate soft strokes.<br />
Then my nerves feel it.<br />
Thermoreceptors, screaming,<br />
telling me to flee.</p>

<p>The light stirs my skin<br />
like a witch does to her stew;<br />
it boils, blisters, scalds,<br />
a hint of burnt waste<br />
floats in the atmosphere.<br />
It hurts, it hurts, my<br />
muscle seethes in blood,<br />
my bones feel the crimson touch,<br />
Cherry-red, eyeballs<br />
droop, and I then throw<br />
my entire self to She; my<br />
body burns brightly.</p>

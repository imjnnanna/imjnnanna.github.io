<h1>Gluttony</h1>
<p class = "post_date">January 5, 2022</p>

<div class = "post_content"><p>I was eating a bag of hot cheetos today. It was the cheap, small, and “healthy” oven-baked bag of nitrogen gas that came with 5 other types of chips in a huge Costco box. I noticed a strange pattern whenever I eat a bag of hot cheetos: I feel a strong, compelling urge to get down to that point in eating where I shake the bag gently, fold out the wrinkles, and toss the remaining crumbles into my mouth in a 45-degree slide. There’s this mysterious, dark force, perhaps the god of the deadly sin, gluttony, overwhelming my brain to keep stabbing those chopsticks, holding a scrumptious, spicy piece, into my mouth and commanding myself to chew it forcefully (if not deliciously) down. There’s no way I can resist a god of a deadly sin, can I?</p>

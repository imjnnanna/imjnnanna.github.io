<h1>30 minutes</h1>
<p class = "post_date">March 14, 2022</p>

<div class = "post_content"><p>30 minutes of steady state, broken down into minute-chunk thought processes that overwhelm my mind. SS usually shouldn’t/isn’t this rough, but it was especially hard today mentally for whatever reason.</p>

<h2 id="breakdowns">Breakdowns</h2>

<p>1: you start too fast. settle down, man, you can’t keep this split.</p>

<p>2: ok, you’re settling too much. keep your goal pace</p>

<p>4: one minute to 5!</p>

<p>5: you’re a sixth of the way there… doing good. keep it up</p>

<p>7: you’re one fifth of the way there.</p>

<p>8: two minutes to 10!</p>

<p>9: one minute to 10!</p>

<p>10: a third of the way. doing really good, five minutes until halfway. keep that goal split, I don’t want to see it drop. keep it. KEEP it. KEEP IT.</p>

<p>12: <em>sings along to Ed Sheeran</em></p>

<p>13: two minutes to halfway!</p>

<p>14: one minute to halfway!</p>

<p>14:30: c’mon, ten more strokes.</p>

<p>15: halfway.</p>

<p>at this point, my optimistic, pushing side says: <em>you’re below your goal pace. let’s keep it that way.</em></p>

<p>my slacking, lazy side: you’re below your goal pace. you have some space to slow down. how about we keep it at goal pace+3, since we’re 3 under?</p>

<p>(my lazy side usually wins, fyi. talk about not pushing myself)</p>

<p>16: I want to throw up</p>

<p>17: maybe I should do a 20 minute piece</p>

<p>18: maybe I should</p>

<p>19: I should</p>

<p>20: I should stop.</p>

<p>20:01: alright, we’re past the 20 minute mark. let’s bring this up to a 30; I KNOW you love doing a 2×30’ more than doing a 3×20’. Imagine doing three of these, instead of two! you literally do not have the mentality today to do three pieces.</p>

<p>21: I should’ve stopped at 20. I want to throw up</p>

<p>22: 8 more minutes. keep pushing. your splits are moving up; keep it down.</p>

<p>23: two minutes to 25!</p>

<p>24: one minute to 25!</p>

<p>25: maybe I should stop here and do a 2×25’</p>

<p>25:01: I should’ve stopped</p>

<p>26: here we go, four more. that’s less than a hundred strokes. ignore the pain. you’re so close, if you give up now you are a disappointment to humanity</p>

<p>27: KEEP YOUR SPLIT</p>

<p>28: TWO MORE MINUTES, PUSH</p>

<p>28.5: I really should’ve stopped earlier</p>

<p>29: ONE MORE, IGNORE THE PAIN. THERE IS NO PAIN. IT’S ALL IN YOUR HEAD. IT’S ALL IN YOUR HEAD</p>

<p>29:30: it’s not in my head</p>

<p>30:</p>

<p>Then I ended up not doing the second 30’ piece because I did have severe knee pain for the last 10 minutes. <del>Didn’t want to risk it</del> I love any kind of injury excuse that gets me to DNF</p>

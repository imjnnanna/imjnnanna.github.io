<h1>Woke Up</h1>
<p class = "post_date">April 10, 2025</p>

<div class = "post_content"><p>Woke up. Went to class. Walked to the next class. Sat through for an hour and fifteen minutes. Walked to the dining hall. Ate a jackfruit sandwich. Walked to the library. Studied and scrolled for forty-five minutes. Joined a Zoom meeting while watching YouTube. Closed the laptop. Walked to rehearsal. Yawned for two and a half hours. Walked back to bed, threw off all clothes, brainrotted. A quick power nap.  Woke up. Went to dinner. Walked back. Finished two problem sets. Yawned. Brushed teeth, showered, routined the skincare, slept.</p>

<p>Woke up. Went to Commons. Ate a Korean Fried Chicken bowl. Walked to the library. Put forehead down on the desk and took a nap. Woke up. Walked to office hours. Wrote down whatever was on the blackboard. Did not understand. Walked to the library. Reviewed notes. Still did not understand. Walked to the exam room. Took exam. Yawned. Left a question blank and went back to the dorm. Brushed teeth. Slept.</p>

<p>Woke up. Went to class. Went to the dining hall. Ate a banana and a scoop of penne pasta. Walked back to the dorm, sat down, scrolled. Scrolled and scrolled. Sat through a Zoom meeting while typing an overdue essay. Began working on a problem set. Yawned a couple times. Closed the laptop. Showered. Slept.</p>

<p>Woke up. Went to the Ivy. Ate chicken. Had a stomachache. Walked back to the dorm and took a nap. Woke up. Watched the full moon. Filled out a Dean’s Extension request for the problem set. Slept.</p>

<p>Woke up. Lay in bed. Slept.</p>

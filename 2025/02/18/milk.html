<h1>Milk</h1>
<p class = "post_date">February 18, 2025</p>

<div class = "post_content"><p>Milk begins the sustainment of all mammals on Earth. Bovine milk, of all, nourishes not only calves, but hundreds of millions of humans of all ages around the world. Milk in a plastic bottle for the newborn. Milk in a breakfast glass with pancakes. Milk in a gym water bottle. Milk with strawberry, chocolate, banana. Milk in a smoothie, milk in cookies, milk in pasta, milk in bread and flan and chow and curds. Creamy, smooth, just barely tinted with the slightest amount of viscosity, a glass of milk contains supplements rivaling the biggest capsules of artificial vitamin and minerals generated from factories and years of R&amp;D by scientists: calcium, vitamin D, potassium, zinc, vitamin A, magnesium, selenium, and of course, for the gymrats religiously drinking cups every day—protein. The mere fact that such a naturally occurring liquid can provide protein proves milk as a miracle and a blessing from the bovine and mammalian heavens; otherwise, you must take the foundations of life—slaughter and take the bones of animals—and boil it, creating a large pot of brown soup known as bone broth, which fails to even surpass the pearly drink in terms of protein per serving.</p>

<p>The curse of lactose intolerance is perhaps one of the saddest and undersympathized diseases on Earth. Milk exists to be drunk and with absolutely no alternatives. The brand Lactaid struggles to find a suitable replacement—by digesting the lactose preemptively, lactose-free milk creates a false sweetness that takes away from the delight stemming from gratifying oneself with a non-sweet drink that flows down the throat without any aftertaste but a slight creaminess. Or soymilk, which is—in the most non-derogatory way possible—beany. Or oatmilk, a water substitute with infused grinded grain. It is most unfortunate that 65% of the world cannot find the pleasure of a sip of rich white liquor that forms the most perfect mechanics of fluid dynamics down your esophagus, settling down in utmost comfort and satiation.</p>

    <h1>Music</h1>
    
    <h2>Viola</h2>
    <p>I am currently a violist in the Yale Symphony Orchestra.</p>
    <p>
        I've been playing viola since I was in seventh grade. 
        In 2023, I performed the <a href="https://youtu.be/PWFKcowBneM">Walton Viola Concerto</a> 
        with the Wallingford Symphony Orchestra as the winner of the 2023 Mitchell Family Fund String Concerto Competition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other prizes I've won include first place at the US International Open Music Competition and the KAMSA Young Artist Competition,
        and second place at the American Protégé International Piano & String Competition.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an ensemble player, I served as the principal violist of the Choate Symphony Orchestra all four years, 
        and was the co-principal violist at the Connecticut Southern Regions Festival.

    <h2>Carillon</h2>
    <p>
        Catch me playing carillon on the Harkness Towers! 
        I'm part of the <a href="http://yalecarillon.org">Yale University Guild of Carilloneurs</a>.

    <h2>Composition</h2>
    <p>
        I composed classical music since I was 11 years old, and pretty much stopped when I was 15, only intermittently writing pieces (& unrecorded) since then.

    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately unrecorded, I premiered my full orchestra piece "Persephone" in 2019 with the California Philharmonic Youth Orchestra. I attended the Tanglewood Institute in Summer 2021 and the Curtis Institute Young Artist Summer Program in 2022 for composition studies.
